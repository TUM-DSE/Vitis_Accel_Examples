DDR Data Retention
==================

This example demonstrates how DDR can hold the data between successive XCLBIN load. The first xclbin dumps the DDR data at the end of the run. The second xclbin  loads the dumped data and starts executing.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Handling Buffer sharing across multiple binaries, Multiple Kernel Binaries

**KEYWORDS:** `enable_memory_persistence <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/xrt.ini-File>`__


This example shows how host can swap between kernels and share the same buffer between two kernels. Since the DDR can hold the data between successive XCLBIN loads, the user can dump data to the DDR using the first xclbin and then reuse the same in successive xclbins directly. This reduces the number of transfers between host and device by 2 for each reuse.

In the design, the host application first programs the device with the binary containing ``krnl_vmult`` and executes the operation.

Before the first kernel call, the common ``d_mul`` buffer is created using ``NULL`` buffer. This is because, it will be populated by the first kernel and then reused by the second kernel and thus, would not require any host side memory to map to.

.. code:: cpp

   OCL_CHECK(err,
             cl::Buffer d_mul(context, CL_MEM_HOST_NO_ACCESS | CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, sizeof(int) * LENGTH, NULL, &err));

The first kernel is run with the following arrangement -

.. code:: cpp

   OCL_CHECK(err, err = krnl_vmul.setArg(0, d_a));
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = krnl_vmul.setArg(1, d_b));
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = krnl_vmul.setArg(2, d_mul));
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = krnl_vmul.setArg(3, vector_length));

   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.enqueueMigrateMemObjects({d_a, d_b}, 0 /* 0 means from host*/));
   
   // This function will execute the kernel on the FPGA
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.enqueueTask(krnl_vmul));
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.finish());

Once the first kernel finishes the operation, the host reprograms the 2nd Binary.

.. code:: cpp

   OCL_CHECK(err, cl::Program program(context, devices, vadd_bins, NULL, &err));

The second kernel is run with the following arrangement -

.. code:: cpp

   OCL_CHECK(err, krnl_vadd.setArg(0, d_mul));
   OCL_CHECK(err, krnl_vadd.setArg(1, d_mul));
   OCL_CHECK(err, krnl_vadd.setArg(2, d_add));
   OCL_CHECK(err, krnl_vadd.setArg(3, vector_length));
   
   // This function will execute the kernel on the FPGA
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.enqueueTask(krnl_vadd));
   
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.enqueueMigrateMemObjects({d_add}, CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST));
   OCL_CHECK(err, err = q.finish());

In order to enable this feature for emulation, the following config settings are required in the ``xrt.ini`` - 

:: 

   [Emulation]
   enable_memory_persistence=true

In order to enable this feature on the board, the following command needs to be given - 

:: 

   xbmgmt config --enable_retention [--ddr] [--card bdf]

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/krnl_vadd.cpp
   src/krnl_vmul.cpp
   
Access these files in the github repo by `clicking here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/master/sys_opt/ddr_data_retention>`__.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./ddr_data_retention -x1 <krnl_vmul XCLBIN> -x2 <krnl_vadd XCLBIN>
