Xilinx IPTables RX Filter
=========================

Xilinx IPTables RX Filter offload engine.


This design showcase an application for the X3 hybrid NIC based on providing IPTables-like functionality on the NIC using System Compiler.

We hope that customers will be able to use this example to make it easy for them to begin using the programmable capabilities of the X3 NIC. They may use it as a starting point and customize it to their needs, or write their own from scratch with a similar structure. 

IPTables is a Linux firewall system to apply packet filters to network traffic. It consists of the iptables utility that configures the current rules and the netfilter kernel module(s) that implement the rules in the kernel. Although the IPTables system has numerous tables and filter points, this example will only be concerned with the INPUT filter chain. Each chain contains a list of rules. The packet is compared to each rule in sequence until a rule matches and a decision is made (e.g. to accept or drop the packet).

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below
