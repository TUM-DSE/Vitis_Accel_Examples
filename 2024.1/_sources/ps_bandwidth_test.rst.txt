PS Bandwidth Test 
==================

This PS validate kernel tests PS kernel functionality.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** PS Kernel


This PS bandwidth test uses PS kernel to run PL bandwidth test.

Extracting Memory Information and generate cfg file:
   
      - Platforminfo -j (path to xpfm) > platform_info.json
      - From the platform_info.json file we pick the memory info
      - Generate the meta data related to Memory Banks(DDR/HBM/HOST) to platform_bandwidth.cfg file


Using the ``sp`` option  in the platform_bandwidth.cfg file AXI-Master Port is connected to the IP:

::

   sp=bandwidth_1.input:MC_NOC0
   sp=bandwidth_1.output:MC_NOC0

Following is the real log reported when running the design on VCK5000:

:: 

   Throughput (Type: DDR) : 23461MB/s
   TEST PASSED

**EXCLUDED PLATFORMS:** 

 - Alveo U25 SmartNIC

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/bandwidth.cpp
   src/host.cpp
   src/ps_bandwidth.c
   src/sk_types.h
   
Access these files in the github repo by `clicking here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/master/validate/ps_bandwidth_test>`__.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./ps_bandwidth_test.exe -p $(GEN_DIR)
